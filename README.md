 ## ü§ç Add-To-Favourites

React application demonstrating the functionality of adding favorite products to a wishlist. Users can easily curate their list of preferred items, stored in locale storage. <br> The application also features the capability to share the wishlist effortlessly through a personalized URL, allowing users to easily share their curated collection with friends and family.

I used Figma to plan the project, and did a small prototype to visualize the different components and pages needed.
